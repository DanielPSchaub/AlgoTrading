# AlgoTrading

After being bored in lockdown in 2020 I, like many others, started to day trade the US stock market. 
After a while of delving into the market though I quickly realized humans are at a distinct disadvantage. 
Computers are faster, more reliable, and unemotional.

Hence this project. 

I found a trading platform that allowed algorithm trading, TradeStation, learned their Java-based language, and built some pattern recognition into it.

Does it work?
Yes.
Does it make money?
No.
Why does it not make money?
Because the patterns I hard-coded into the program worked in the past, and not currently.

The next step for future projects will to build a program that takes recent priceing&volume data to learn patterns to then trade.
